                            Welcome to ATM2BT
                        </h1>
                        <p align="justify">
                            Following footsteps of Werner Heisenberg and many other scientists across the globe, ATM2BT consortium is attempting to gain better understanding of one of the last standing problems of classical mechanics â€“ that of turbulent motion in fluids, gases and solids. Utilising our international experience, we aim to investigate turbulence from atomistic and molecular level, and build our understanding of the bulk turbulence using insights obtained from the micro-world.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            ATM2BT will combine pioneering methods to investigate the invariable different stages and bifurcating sequences of the onset of turbulent hydrodynamics at scales just above the Kolmogorov scale, applied to a variety of geometric configurations for a three-front approach in simulating, probing and understanding the structure of turbulence: turbulence, with its effects in our daily lives at the macro-cosmos captured from its fingerprints at the nano-scale. By bringing together the atomistic fluid and plastic flow at nano/micro-scale and their instabilities we will extend acquired knowledge through new innovative technologies to bulk fluid dynamics at the macro scale, in order to better understand fundamental aspects of turbulent flow and, through its plastics pathway, apply it to better engineering solutions. We are bringing together a diverse world leading multidisciplinary team comprising of Japanese (RIKEN, Akita University, Kansai University, Future University Hakodate) and EU (Aston University, Queen Mary University of London, The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) Institutions in order to create a comprehensive, accurate and reliable predictive modelling framework to probe the inner secrets of turbulence. The different and diverse expertise available will not just enable, but actively encourage interaction and knowledge sharing to improve current understanding and enable new technology creation.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The teams will address the challenges associated with the effect of the dominant nano/microstructure and its role in upscaling stochasticity to the macro scale, in order to create a fully deterministic, holistic, innovative multiscale framework, which will be tested and validated at a range of scales as part of the project delivery.  Our final goal will be to bring this framework of theoretical discoveries, represented in the form of a Unified nano-macro fluid flow accumulating state-of-the-art software, a Universal Modelling Software Tool (UMST), describing the genesis and evolution of turbulence from fundamental to scales, encountered in our everyday lives.
